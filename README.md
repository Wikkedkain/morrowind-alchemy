# Astro Starter Kit: Basics


## Brainstorming
1. tokenfield input?
   1. https://sliptree.github.io/bootstrap-tokenfield/
2. filtering table?
3. Select an effect to filter
   1. e.g., Select "Invisibility" in the table to filter all ingredients with that effect
   2. Then Select another effect "Detect Key" to include ingredients with that effect as well

## Goals
1. Quick lookup of an ingredients effects (ingredient -> effects)
2. Quick lookup of all ingredients with an effect (effect -> ingredients)
3. Potion building
   1. Combine ingredients to get multiple effects
   2. Start with effect? Or start with ingredients?
4. Add Tamriel Data ingredients
   1. toggle to include
5. Static + Cache everything

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
